# Happiness-analysis.
What make us happy and in which countries do the happiest people live?

**Installations:**

I used the Python 3.7.6 over Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3. in Anaconda.

**Project Motivation**

I would like to analyse, what are the main factors that influence happiness and look if or how corona times influenced happiness perceptions.

**File Descriptions**

In my analysis I use 3 datasets of Happiness from 2018, 2019 and 2020 and dataset of latest COVID-19 confirmed cases from 2020.
