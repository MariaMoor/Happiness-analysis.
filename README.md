# Happiness-analysis.
What make us happy and in which countries do the happiest people live?

**Installations:**

I used the Python 3.7.6 over Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3. in Anaconda.

**Project Motivation**

I would like to analyse, what are the main factors that influence happiness and look if or how corona times influenced happiness perceptions.

**File Descriptions**

In my analysis I use 3 datasets of Happiness from 2018 (Happiness_datasets_748584_1294786_2018.csv), 2019 (Happiness_datasets_748584_1294786_2019.csv) and 2020 (Happiness_datasets_748584_1294786_2020.csv) in this datasets there are happiness scores per country and values for the factors, that this score may depend on.
Additionally there is a dataset of latest COVID-19 confirmed cases from 2020 (Covid_country_wise_latest.csv). I just take the values of confirmed cases per county.
And of cause I have uploaded my code (Happiness research.ipynb).
