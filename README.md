# Happiness-analysis.
What make us happy and in which countries do the happiest people live?

**Installations:**

I used the Python 3.7.6 over Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3. in Anaconda.

**Project Motivation**

I would like to analyse, where do you need to live to have more chance to be happy, what are the main factors that influence happiness and if or how corona times influenced happiness perceptions.

**File Descriptions**

1) In my analysis I use 3 datasets of Happiness from 2018 (Happiness_datasets_748584_1294786_2018.csv), 2019 (Happiness_datasets_748584_1294786_2019.csv) and 2020 (Happiness_datasets_748584_1294786_2020.csv) in this datasets there are happiness scores per country and values for the factors, that this score may depend on.
You can find more information about this dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report

2) Additionally there is a dataset of latest COVID-19 confirmed cases from 2020 (Covid_country_wise_latest.csv). I just take the values of confirmed cases per country.
You can find more information about this dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report?select=covid_19_clean_complete.csv

3) And of cause I have uploaded my code (Happiness research.ipynb).

**Results**

Making my analysis I came to the following results:

1) If you live in Finland, you have the most chance to be happy! It stays on the first place for all three years! Almost all of other countries (8 from 9) are also stay in the first 10 countries by happiness during all 3 years. They are: Denmark, Swirzerland, Iceland, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden New Zealand and Austria.

2) It looks like the score is quite stable over 3 years (looking at constant, a little bit growing mean and slightly falling standard deviation) and even growing a little bit (looking at slightly growing mean, 25%, 75% and max values).

3) GDP per capita, Social support and Healthy life expectancy are the main factors explaining happiness score. On the other hand, Freedom to make life choises and Generosity seem to have much less influence on Happiness of people, based on our datasets.

4) Corona doesnt have much influence on the explanation of Happiness
